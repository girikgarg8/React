Chapter-04 was an interesting session where we started to develop a config-driven UI for food ordering platform. First, we created LLD of the web application, continued working on creating layouts, components and data manipulation from mock data. Concepts of props(properties), virtual DOM, importance of unique key were discussed. Find my version of detailed explanation of these concepts in theory-assignment.md

I have shared the steps to think in React and develop an application in notes.md. Using this knowledge, I have created a food ordering app named FoodVilla in this chapter. This chapter is the basic step and lots of enhancements needs to be done in the upcoming chapters.

One line about this chapter : Props (properties) passed in Component are similar to the arguments passed in a js function call and received by the function definition as parameters.
