Polyfill:  Polfyfill means replacing code with the code that browser understands
  eg. if older version of JS doesn't understand map() function, or maybe an old version of browser doesn't understand promises , babel may write own custom implementation of map() so that code is able to execute

Babel performs the task of generating the polyfill, for any newer functions of JS, whose implementation is not understood by browser.
