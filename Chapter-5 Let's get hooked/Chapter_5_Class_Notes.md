Q. Why do we create a folder named src in the project structure?

A. It's not a compulsion from the React library to use the src folder. However, using src folder is a common industry practice to keep the project structure organised, and so that finding files becomes easier. So, we can move all the React code into the src folder for better project structure and modularity approach.
