Chapter-05 was the continuation of previous chapter where we started to develop a food delivery app. In this chapter, we re-organised the repo structure, understood the importance of clean coding principles, different ways of exporting and importing modules(components). Then, the hero of this chapter `Hooks` got everyone hooked to their screen. It was indeed a 3 hours knowledge heavy session where foundation of hooks was laid. We used hooks to filter the restaurants based on search input. 

After today's session, got a better understanding of [Thinking in React](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/thinking-in-react).


One line about this chapter : `Hook is just normal function which manages the local variable(state), which can only be modified using it's function useState() to create a state and assign a initial value and setState() to update the state.`
