Q. What do we need to make our React app production ready, compared to the static page which we prepared in first class?

A. There are several things which we need to do, like:
    1. Minifying the files
    2. Removing the console log's
    3. Optimizing the performance of app by using bundlers to compress all the React code into a single file

Here, we are creating our own create-react-app, and understanding what happens behing the scene when we use create-react-app as an abstraction.

Different bundlers: Webpack, Vite, Parcel

create-react-app internally uses webpack as the bundler. 

In this tutorial, we'll be using parcel as the bundler.

Now, parcel is a package, and so we need to install it using npm.

Alternative to npm is yarn, but we are going ahead with using npm.

There's no official name for npm, NPM doesn't stand for Node Package Manager.

In order to use NPM, we need to use npm init, and enter the various details as required.

Q. What is NPM, and why do we need it inside our React App?

A.  NPM helps us to manage the dependencies in out React App. Maven:Java :: NPM:React
    We need NPM in our React app so that we can use various packages (superpowers :D) which we need in our React app, such as bundlers, minifiers etc.

Q. How do we ignite our app?

A.  By installing parcel bundler, it is a zero coniguration tool. It has similar features which Vite or Webpack has to offer.

We'll install parcel as a dev-dependency in our project, using the command `npm install -D parcel ` or `npm install --save-dev parcel`, both of them indicate that parcel is being installed as a dev-dependency.

Q. What are dev-dependencies?

A.  Dev-dependencies are those dependencies which are required only in the development environment (the developer's machine), and not the production environment. Examples of dev-dependencies include loggers, testing libraries etc

dev-dependencies are specified in the package.json file (not in the package-lock.json file)

Q. What does caret (^) and tilde (~) sign represent in the version of packages in package.json file?

Syntax: The syntax of the npm version looks like the following.

Major.Minor.Patch

`^ (caret)` represents that the minor and patch version can be upgraded, i.e. if dependency is specified as `^2.3.1` then it can be uppgraded to version 2.4.3 or 2.3.5, when installing.

`~ (tilde)` represents that only patch version can be upgraded, i.e. if dependency is specified as `~2.3.1` then it can be upgraded to 2.3.x only while installing.

Q. What is the difference between the package.json and package-lock.json files? 

A. Refer this article: [Difference Between Package.json and package-lock.json files](https://dillionmegida.com/p/package-vs-package-lock-json/)

With package-lock.json, the versions of all dependencies your package would need are locked (-lock). This means when you run npm install on another system, npm checks this file to install the exact versions of the dependencies. If this file is absent, npm would then work with the caret symbol.

We all have encountered the issue, when we say "code runs on my machine but not on production", this is because of mismatch of the dependency versions on the production and development environments, so to prevent such issues, we `SHOULD ALWAYS COMMIT PACKAGE-LOCK.JSON` on to the git repository.

Q. Look at the node_modules folder, what are all these folders and files which are present inside this folder?

A. One important point to understand here is that we have installed parcel, parcel has dependencies on other packages, and these packages may have dependencies on other packages. So, the node_modules has all the packages which are required for parcel, like browsersList (which enables us to use the React app on older browsers also), among other packages.

Don't get intimated by the size of node_modules or the number of packages in node_modules folder, it has various memes on it for a reason :)

![Meme on node_modules](Node_modules_meme.png)

`NEVER` push node_modules onto git repository, because node_modules is a very heavy folder, which occupies a lot of space, also node_modules can be regenerated by installing the package-lock.json file again on the production machine.
