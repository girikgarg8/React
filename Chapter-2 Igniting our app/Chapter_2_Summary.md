`Chapter-02` was about creating production-ready react app from scratch without using create-react-app. Production-ready app on the second day of a course ? sounds interesting right !!? The concept of `bundlers` (Parcel) was explained in detail. We all assume React is the one superpower that makes the application faster, though it is partially right, the major credit goes to the other packages/helper utilities (Bundler) for speeding up the application, optimizing the code, improving the performance and lots more. Find the other interesting powerful featured of bundler in class notes. 


One line about this chapter : As Akshay says `Parcel` is a `BEAST`.
